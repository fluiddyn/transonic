Backends (Pythran, Cython, Numba, ...)
======================================

Transonic can use different tools to accelerate the code. We use the name
"backend".

The default backend is Pythran and currently, there are 3 other backends
("cython", "numba" or "python"). (The "python" backend is mainly used for
internal testing.)

There are different methods to choose which backend is used:

- An environment variable :code:`TRANSONIC_BACKEND` (which has to be "pythran",
  "cython", "numba" or "python") should be used to change the backend globally
  for one process.

- The ``transonic`` commandline has an option ``-b`` (``--backend``).

- The functions :func:`transonic.backends.make_backend_files` and
  :func:`transonic.dist.init_transonic_extensions` have an optional argument
  ``backend``. Note that these functions should be imported from the
  :mod:`transonic.dist` package.

- There are two functions :func:`transonic.config.set_backend` and
  :func:`transonic.backends.set_backend_for_this_module`. Note that these
  functions can be imported from the :mod:`transonic` package.

- The ``boost`` and ``jit`` decorators have an optional argument ``backend``.
